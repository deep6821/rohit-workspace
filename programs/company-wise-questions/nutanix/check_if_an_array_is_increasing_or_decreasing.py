"""
Given an array arr[] of N elements where N â‰¥ 2, the task is to check the type
of array whether it is:
1. Increasing.
2. Decreasing.
3. Increasing then decreasing.
4. Decreasing then increasing.

Note that the given array is definitely one of the given types.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: Increasing
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3}
Output: Increasing then decreasing

Approach: The following conditions must satisfy for:
1. Increasing array: The first two and the last two elements must be in
   increasing order.
2. Decreasing array: The first two and the last two elements must be in
   decreasing order.
3. Increasing then decreasing array: The first two elements must be in
   increasing order and the last two elements must be in decreasing order.
4. Decreasing then increasing array: The first two elements must be in
   decreasing order and the last two elements must be in increasing order.
