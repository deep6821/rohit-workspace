Input : 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
Output : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Explanation: The output is a sorted array of 0 and 1

Approach: This concept is related to partition of quick sort . In quick sortâ€™
partition, after one scan, the left of the array is smallest and
right of the array is the largest of selected pivot element.
