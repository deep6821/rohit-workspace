"""
Let n be the size of the list of integers and m be the sum of the list elements.

Time complexity:
----------------
The binary search will take O(log(m)) time in the low and high range. Each time we pick a mid-value,
we traverse over n elements of the list, so the total time complexity will be O(n√ólog(m)).

Space complexity:
-----------------
The space complexity will be O(1) because constant space is utilized.
