"""
Explanation:
------------
This solution is pretty straight forward. Just make another graph, but start
reversing it.

Traverse the adjacency list of the given graph andâ€”on encountering a vertex v
in the adjacency list of vertex u (i.e. an edge from u to v in the given graph)
simply add an edge from v to u in the transpose graph
(i.e. add u in the adjacency list of vertex v of the new graph).

Time complexity:
----------------
The graph is traversed only once, hence, time complexity is O(V + E).
