- Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm in which the problem is
repeatedly divided into sub-problems until we reach a point where each problem
is similar and atomic, i.e., canâ€™t be further divided. At this point, we start
solving these atomic problems and combining (merging) the solutions.

- So, divide and conquer solutions have the following three steps:
1. Divide
2. Conquer
3. Merge
