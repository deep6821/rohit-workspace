"""
Insertion sort is another famous sorting algorithm and works the way you would
naturally sort in real life.

It iterates over the given list, figures out what the correct position of every
element is, and inserts it there.

Time complexity:
----------------
The algorithm is O(n^2), which, again, makes it a poor choice for large input
sizes. However, notice that the complexity is actually n^2, only when the input
list is sorted in reverse. So, the â€˜best-caseâ€™ complexity
(when the list is sorted in the correct order) is Omega(n).

Space complexity:
-----------------
Also, note that all of these algorithms are in-place, hence their space
complexity is in O(1).
