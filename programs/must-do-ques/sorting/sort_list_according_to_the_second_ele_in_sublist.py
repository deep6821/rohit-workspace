"""
sort () and sorted(): Itâ€™s called Timsort. It's an exceptionally adaptive merge sort, which is
miraculous in practice, but asymptotically itâ€™s no better than merge sort

Time complexity of sort and sorted : O(n log n) both on average and in the worst case. sorted is like
sort except that the first builds a new sorted list from an iterable while sort do sort in place.

Space complexity of sort and sorted: sort() worst case space complexity is O(N) and best case O(1) and
sorted()

timsort can require a temp array containing as many as N//2 pointers, which means as many as 2*N extra
bytes on 32-bit boxes. It can be expected to require a temp array this large when sorting random data;
on data with significant structure, it may get away without using any extra heap memory.
