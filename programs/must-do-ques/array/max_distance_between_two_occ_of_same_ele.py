"""
Maximum distance between two occurrences of same element in array
Given an array with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance two occurrences of an
element.

- A simple solution for this problem is to one by one pick each element from array and find its first and
last occurrence in array and take difference of first and last occurrence for maximum distance.
Time complexity for this approach is O(n2).

- An efficient solution for this problem is to use hashing. The idea is to traverse input array and store
index of first occurrence in a hash map. For every other occurrence, find the difference between index
and the first index stored in hash map. If difference is more than result so far, then update the result.
