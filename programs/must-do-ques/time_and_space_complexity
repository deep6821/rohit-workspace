Time Complexity: is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount
of input to the algorithm. In layman’s terms, We can say time complexity is sum of number of times each
statements gets executed.

Space Complexity: is a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the
amount of input to the algorithm. When we say “this algorithm takes constant extra space,” because the
amount of extra memory needed doesn’t vary with the number of items processed.
