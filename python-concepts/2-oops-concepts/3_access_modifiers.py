- In Python, we can impose access restrictions on different data members and member functions.
- The restrictions are specified through access modifiers.
- Access modifiers are tags we can associate with each member to define which parts of the
  program can access it directly.
- There are two types of access modifiers in Python. Letâ€™s take a look at them one by one. """

"""
1. Public attributes: are those that be can be accessed inside the class and outside the class.
   - Technically in Python, all methods and properties in a class are publicly available by default.
     If we want to suggest that a method should not be used publicly, we have to declare it as private
    explicitly. """

The aim is to keep it hidden from the users and other classes. Unlike in many different languages, 
it is not a widespread practice in Python to keep the data members private since we do not want to 
create hindrances for the users. We can make members private using the double underscore __ prefix """
