What is Flask?
--------------
Flask is a web framework that provides libraries to build lightweight web applications in python. It is developed by
Armin Ronacher who leads an international group of python enthusiasts (POCCO).

It is based on WSGI toolkit and jinja2 template engine. Flask is considered as a micro framework.

What is WSGI?
-------------
It is an acronym for web server gateway interface which is a standard for python web application development. It is
considered as the specification for the universal interface between the web server and web application.


Flask URL Building:
------------------
The "url_for()" function is used to build a URL to the specific function dynamically. The first argument is the name of
the specified function, and then we can pass any number of keyword argument corresponding to the variable part of the URL

Benefits of the Dynamic URL Building:
-------------------------------------
1. It avoids hard coding of the URLs.
2. We can change the URLs dynamically instead of remembering the manually changed hard-coded URLs.
3. URL building handles the escaping of special characters and Unicode data transparently.
4. The generated paths are always absolute, avoiding unexpected behavior of relative paths in browsers.
5. If your application is placed outside the URL root, for example, in /myapplication instead of /, url_for() properly
handles that for you.

Jinga2 template:
---------------
Jinga 2 template engine provides some delimiters which can be used in the HTML to make it capable of dynamic data
representation. The template system provides some HTML syntax which are placeholders for variables and expressions
that are replaced by their actual values when the template is rendered.

The jinga2 template engine provides the following delimiters to escape from the HTML.
{% ... %} for statements
{{ ... }} for expressions to print to the template output
{# ... #} for the comments that are not included in the template output
# ... ## for line statements
