Briefly explain Django Field Class:
-----------------------------------

‘Field’ is basically an abstract class that actually represents a column in the database table. The Field class,
is in turn, a subclass of  RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are used to create database
tables (db_type()) which are used to map Python types to the database using get_prep_value() and vice versa
using from_db_value() method. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in different Django APIs such as models and
querysets.
