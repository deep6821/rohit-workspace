What are ‘sessions’?
- Sessions are fully supported in Django. Using the session framework, you can easily store and retrieve arbitrary
data based on the per-site-visitors. This framework basically stores data on the server-side and takes care of
sending and receiving cookies. These cookies consist of a session ID but not the actual data itself unless you
explicitly use a cookie-based backend.

*********************************************************************************************************
By default, django saves session information in database(django_session table or collection), but you can
configure the engine to store information using other ways like: file and cache.

What do you mean by context?
- Context in Django is a dictionary mapping template variable name given to Python objects. This is the conventional
name, but you can give any other name of your choice if you wish to do it.
