How to use file-based sessions?
-------------------------------
- In order to make use of file-based sessions, you will need to set the SESSION_ENGINE setting to
“django.contrib.sessions.backends.file”.

Give the exception classes present in Django:
--------------------------------------------
- Django uses its own exceptions as well as those present in Python. Django core exceptions are present in
django.core.exceptions class some of which are mentioned in the table below:

Exception                       Description
---------                       -----------
1. AppRegistryNotReady          Raised when you try to use your models before the app loading process (initializes the ORM) is completed.
2. ObjectDoesNotExist           This is the base class for DoesNotExist exceptions.
3. EmptyResultSet               This exception may be raised if a query won’t return any result.
4. FieldDoesNotExist            This exception is raised by a model’s _meta.get_field() function in case the requested field does not exist
5. MultipleObjectsReturned      This is raised by a query if multiple objects are returned and only one object was expected
