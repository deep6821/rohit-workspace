Django architecture:
--------------------

- Django follows the Model View Template architecture which is based on the Model View Controller architecture.
- The main difference between these two is that Django itself take care of the controller part.

The ‘controller’ here is Django itself which sends the request to the appropriate view in accordance with the
specified URL. This is why Django is referred to as MTV rather than MVC architecture.

According to Django, the ‘view’ basically describes the data presented to the user. It does not deal with how the
data looks but rather what the data actually is. Views are basically callback functions for the specified URL’s and
these callback functions describe which data is presented.

The ‘templates’ on the other hand deal with the presentation of data, thereby, separating the content from its
presentation. In Django, views delegate to the templates to present the data.
