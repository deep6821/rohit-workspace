1. Is Django a CMS?

- Django is not a CMS (content-management-system) . It is just a Web framework, a tool that allows you to build
websites.

2. Does Django support NoSQL?

- NoSQL basically stands for “not only SQL”. This is considered as an alternative to the traditional RDBMS or the
relational Databases.
- Officially, Django does not support NoSQL databases. However, there are third-party projects, such as Django
non-rel, that allow NoSQL functionality in Django. Currently, you can use MongoDB and Google App Engine.

3. What should be done in case you get a message saying “Please enter the correct username and password” even
after entering the right details to log in to the admin section?

- In case you have entered the right details and still not able to login to the admin site, cross verify if the
user account has is_active and is_staff attributes set to True.
- The admin site allows only those users for whom these values are set to True.

4. What should be done in case you are not able to log in even after entering the right details and you get no
error message?

- In this case, the login cookie is not being set rightly. This happens if the domain of the cookie sent out by
Django does not match the domain in your browser.
- For this, you must change the SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN setting to match that of your browser.

5. How can you limit admin access so that the objects can only be edited by those users who have created them?

- Django’s ModelAdmin class provides customization hooks using which, you can control the visibility and
editability of objects in the admin.
- To do this, you can use the get_queryset() and has_change_permission().

6. What to do when you don’t see all objects appearing on the admin site?

- Inconsistent row counts are a result of missing Foreign Key values or if the Foreign Key field is set to
null=False.
- If the ForeignKey points to a record that does not exist and if that foreign is present in the list_display
method, the record will not be shown the admin changelist.

7. What do you mean by the csrf_token?

- The csrf_token is used for protection against Cross-Site Request Forgeries.
- This kind of attack takes place when a malicious website consists of a link, some JavaScript or a form whose
aim is to perform some action on your website by using the login credentials of a genuine user.

8. Does Django support multiple-column Primary Keys?

- No. Django only supports single-column Primary Keys.

9. How can you see the raw SQL queries that Django is running?

- First, make sure that your DEBUG setting is set to True. Then, type the following commands:
1. from django.db import connection
2. connection.queries

10. How to make a variable available to all the templates?

- You can make use of the RequestContext in case all your templates require the same objects, such as, in the
case of menus.
- This method takes an HttpRequest as its first parameter and it automatically populates the context with a few
variables, according to the engine’s context_processors configuration option.
