------------------------------------------

The HTTP headers are used to pass additional information between the clients and the server through
the request and response header.

All the headers are case-insensitive, headers fields are separated by colon, key-value pairs in
clear-text string format.

The end of the header section denoted by an empty field header.

There are a few header fields that can contain the comments. And a few headers can contain quality(q)
key-value pairs that separated by an equal sign.

There are four kinds of headers context-wise:
1. General Header: This type of headers applied on Request and Response headers both but with out
affecting the database body.
2. Request Header: This type of headers contains information about the fetched request by the client.
3. Response Header: This type of headers contains the location of the source that has been requested
by the client.
4. Entity Header: This type of headers contains the information about the body of the resources like
MIME type, Content-length.

2. Keep-Alive
3. Proxy-Authenticate
