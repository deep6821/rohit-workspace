- Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

- A Dockerfile must begin with a From Instruction. The From instruction specifies the parent image from which
 you are building.

- The images is usually built by executing Docker instruction, which adds layers on top of existing images.

- The final docker image can be considered as a layered structure where there is a core or a base image and on the top
  of that, there are several layered intermediate images.
