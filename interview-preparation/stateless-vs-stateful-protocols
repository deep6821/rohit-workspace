Both Stateless and stateful protocols are the network protocols for the web servers and web browsers.
These protocols are differentiated based on the server side to save session information.

1	Definition	            Stateless Protocol is a network     Stateful Protocol is a network protocol
                            protocol in which Client send       in which if client send a request to the
                            request to the server and server    server then it expects some kind of
                            response back as per the given      response, in case of no response then
                            state.                              it resend the request

2	Examples	            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)  FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Telnet.
                            UDP (User Datagram Protocol),
                            DNS (Domain Name System)

3	Server Restriction	    In Stateless, server is not needed  In stateful, a server is required to
                            to keep the server information or   maintain the current state and session
                            session details to itself.          information.

4	Dependency	            In stateless, server and client     In stateful, server and client are
                            are loosely coupled and can act     tightly bound.
                            independently.

5	Design	                Server design is simple to          Server design is comparatively complex
                                                                and difficult to implement.
6	Crash Proof	            A failed server can be              A server has to keep the information of

                                                                management is difficult.

7	Transactions	        Server handles transactions         Server is slow comparatively.
                            in a very quicker way.
