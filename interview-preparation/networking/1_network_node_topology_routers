1. What is a Network?
Answer: Network is defined as a set of devices connected to each other using a
        physical transmission medium.

For Example, A computer network is a group of computers connected with each
other to communicate and share information and resources like hardware, data,
and software. In a network, nodes are used to connect two or more networks.

2. What is a Node?
Answer: Two or more computers are connected directly by an optical fiber or any
        other cable. A node is a point where a connection is established. It is
        a network component that is used to send, receive and forward the
        electronic information.

A device connected to a network is also termed as Node. Let's consider that in
a network there are 2 computers, 2 printers, and a server are connected, then
we can say that there are five nodes on the network.

3. What is Network Topology?
Answer: Network topology is a physical layout of the computer network and it
defines how the computers, devices, cables, etc are connected to each other.

4. What are Routers?
Answer: The router is a network device that connects two or more network
segments. It is used to transfer information from the source to the destination.

Routers send the information in terms of data packets and when these data
packets are forwarded from one router to another router then the router reads
the network address in the packets and identifies the destination network.
