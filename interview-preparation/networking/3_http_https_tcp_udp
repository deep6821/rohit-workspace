1. What is HTTP and what port does it use?
Answer: HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is responsible for web
        content. Many web pages are using HTTP to transmit the web content and
        allow the display and navigation of HyperText. It is the primary
        protocol and port used here is TCP port 80.

2. What is HTTPs and what port does it use?
Answer: HTTPs is a Secure HTTP. HTTPs is used for secure communication over a
        computer network. HTTPs provides authentication of websites that
        prevents unwanted attacks.

In bi-directional communication, the HTTPs protocol encrypts the communication
so that the tampering of the data gets avoided. With the help of an SSL
certificate, it verifies if the requested server connection is a valid
connection or not. HTTPs use TCP with port 443.

3. What are TCP and UDP?
Answer: Common factors in TCP and UDP are:
. TCP and UDP are the most widely used protocols that are built on the top of the IP protocol.
. Both protocols TCP and UDP are used to send bits of data over the Internet, which is also known as
‘packets’.
. When packets are transferred using either TCP or UDP, it is sent to an IP address. These packets are
traversed through routers to the destination.

The difference between TCP and UDP are enlisted in the below table:
TCP                                                 UDP
a) TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol     UDP is stands for User Datagram Protocol or Universal
                                                    Datagram Protocol
b) Once the connection is setup, data can be sent   UDP is connectionless, simple protocol. Using UDP
bi-directional i.e. TCP is a connection oriented    messages are sent as packets
protocol

c) The speed of TCP is slower than UDP              UDP is faster compared to TCP

d) TCP is used for the application where            UDP is suitable for the applications which require fast
time is not critical part of data                   transmission of data and time is crucial in this case.
transmission

e) TCP transmission occurs in a sequential          UDP transmission also occurs in a sequential manner but
manner                                              it does not maintain the same sequence when it reaches
                                                    the destination

f) It is heavy weight connection                    It is lightweight transport layer

g) TCP tracks the data sent to ensure               UDP does not ensure whether receiver receives packets
no data loss during data transmission               are not. If packets are misses then they are just lost
