What happens when you type a URL in the browser and press enter?
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. You type maps.google.com into the address bar of your browser.
2. The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding
IP address of maps.google.com.

*****
DNS(Domain Name System) is a database that maintains the name of the website (URL) and the particular
IP address it links to.

Every single URL on the internet has a unique IP address assigned to it. The IP address belongs to the
computer which hosts the server of the website we are requesting to access.

For example, www.google.com has an IP address of 209.85.227.104. So if you’d like, you can reach
www.google.com by typing http://209.85.227.104 on your browser.

DNS is a list of URLs, and their IP addresses, like how a phone book is a list of names and their
corresponding phone numbers.

***** To find the DNS record, the browser checks four caches *****
a. First, it checks the browser cache. The browser maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed
duration for websites you have previously visited. So, it is the first place to run a DNS query.

b. The browser checks the OS cache. If it is not in the browser cache, the browser will make a
system call (i.e., gethostname on Windows) to your underlying computer OS to fetch the record since the
OS also maintains a cache of DNS records.

c. It checks the router cache. If it’s not on your computer, the browser will communicate with
the router that maintains its’ own cache of DNS records.

d. It checks the ISP cache. If all steps fail, the browser will move on to the ISP. Your ISP
maintains its’ own DNS server, which includes a cache of DNS records, which the browser would check with
the last hope of finding your requested URL.

3. If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the
server that hosts maps.google.com.
