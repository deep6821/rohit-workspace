1. Mention the list of objects of Kubernetes?
Objects that are used in Kubernetes are:
a) Pods
b) Replication sets and controllers
c) Jobs and cron jobs
d) Daemon sets
e) Distinctive identities
f) Deployments
g) Stateful sets.

2. Pods
- A pod is a combination of single or multiple containers that logically run together on nodes.
- There are two types of pods in Kubernetes:
a) Single Container Pod: It can be created with the run command.
b) Multicontainer pods: It can be created using the "create" command in Kubernetes.

Single Container Pod: It can be created with the run command.
Multicontainer pods: It can be created using the "create" command in Kubernetes.

3. Explain Replica set
A Replica set is used to keep replica pods stable. It enables us to specify the available number of identical pods.
This can be considered a replacement for the replication .controller.

4. Jobs and cron jobs

5. Daemon sets
Daemon sets are a set of pods that runs on a host. They are used for host layers attributes like monitoring
network or simple network

Daemon sets are used because:
a) It enables to runs storage platforms like ceph and glusterd on each node.
b) Daemon sets run the logs collection on every node such as filebeat or fluentd.
c) It performs node monitoring on each and every node.

6. Distinctive identities

7. Deployments

8. Stateful sets
The stateful set is a workload API object that is used to manage the stateful application. It can also be used
to manage the deployments and scaling the sets of pods. The state information and other data of stateful pods
are store in the disk storage, which connects with stateful set.
