1. Define orchestration in Kubernetes
Orchestration in Kubernetes defines as an automatic method of scheduling the work of every container.
It is used for applications that are based on microservices within clusters.

2. The tools for container orchestration are
a) Docker swarm
b) Apache Mesos
c) Kubernetes.

3. What is the difference between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
The difference between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm is:
Kubernetes	                                        Docker Swarm
----------                                          ------------
a) Kubernetes Provides an auto-scaling feature.	    Docker Swarm does not provide an auto-scaling feature.
b) Manually configure your load balancing settings.	Does auto load balancing
c) Installation is complicated & time-consuming.	Installation is easy & fast.
d) GUI is available.	                            GUI not available.
e) It provides a built-in load balancing technique.	Process scheduling is done to maintain services while updating.

4. Mention the difference between Docker volumes and Kubernetes Volumes
Kubernetes Volumes	                            Docker Volumes
------------------                              --------------
a) Volumes are not limited to any container.	Volumes are limited to a pod in the container.
b) Kubernetes volumes support all containers    Docker volumes do not support all containers deployed in Docker.
deployed in a pod of Kubernetes.

5. What is Sematext Docker Agent?
- Sematext Docker agent is a log collection agent with events and metrics. It runs as a small container in each
Docker host.
- These agents gather metrics, events, and logs for all cluster nodes and containers.
