In simple terms, 
  authentication is the process of verifying who the user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

Ex:
When you go through security in an airport, you show your ID card to authenticate your identity then when you arrive at the gate, you present your boarding pass to the flight attendant, so they can authorize you to board flight and allow access to the plan.
