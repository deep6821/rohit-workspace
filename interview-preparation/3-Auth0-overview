Auth0 Overview:
--------------
- Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and 
  authorization services to your applications.

- The team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that 
  comes with building your own solution to authenticate and 
  authorize users.

- Based on your app's technology, choose one of our SDKs, and hook 
  it up to your app. 
  
  Now each time a user tries to authenticate, Auth0 will verify 
  their identity and send the required information back to your app.

Why use Auth0?
-------------
1. You built an awesome app and you want to add user authentication 
   and authorization. Your users should be able to log in either 
   with username/password or with their social accounts (such as 
   Facebook or Twitter).

   You want to retrieve the user's profile after the login so you can
   customize the UI and apply your authorization policies.

2. You built an API and you want to secure it with OAuth 2.0.

3. You have more than one app, and you want to implement 
   Single Sign-on (SSO).

4. You built a JavaScript front-end app and a mobile app, and you 
   want them both to securely access your API.

5. You have a web app which needs to authenticate users using 
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).

6. You believe passwords are broken and you want your users to log 
   in with one-time codes delivered by email or SMS.

7. If one of your user's email addresses is compromised in some 
   site's public data breach, you want to be notified, and you want 
   to notify the users and/or block them from logging in to your app 
   until they reset their password.

8. You want to act proactively to block suspicious IP addresses if 
   they make consecutive failed login attempts, in order to avoid 
   DDoS attacks.

9. You are part of a large organization who wants to federate their 
   existing enterprise directory service to allow employees to log 
   in to the various internal and third-party applications using 
   their existing enterprise credentials.

10. You don't want (or you don't know how) to implement your own 
    user management solution. Password resets, creating, provisioning, 
    blocking, and deleting users, and the UI to manage all these. You 
    just want to focus on your app.

Which industry standards does Auth0 use?
---------------------------------------
1. Open Authorization (OAuth) 1: the original standard for access 
   delegation. Used as a way for a user to grant websites access to 
   their information on other websites or apps, but without giving 
   them the credentials.

2. Open Authorization (OAuth) 2: an authorization standard that 
   allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one 
   site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials. 
   You use this standard every time you log in to a site using your 
   Google account and you are asked if you agree with sharing your 
   email address and your contacts list with that site.

3. OpenID Connect (OIDC): an identity layer that sits on top of 
   OAuth 2 and allows for easy verification of the user's identity, 
   as well the ability to get basic profile information from the 
   identity provider.

4. JSON Web Tokens (JWT): an open standard that defines a compact 
   and self-contained way for securely transmitting information 
   between parties as a JSON object.

5. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): an open-standard, 
   XML-based data format that allows businesses to communicate user 
   authentication and authorization information to partner companies 
   and enterprise applications their employees may use.

6. WS-Federation (WS-Fed): a standard developed by Microsoft, and 
   used extensively in their applications. It defines the way 
   security tokens can be transported between different entities to 
   exchange identity and authorization information.

Example:
- More importantly oAuth was originally created not for a service to 
  authorize a person, it was meant for a service to authorize to 
  another service.

- Requirement:
----------------------------------
|   Photo Printing Website        |
|                                 |
|   Upload photo >> select        |
|   Pay >> select                 |
|   Order prints >> button        |
-----------------------------------

Suppose there is an website(photo printing), where you give them an 
image file and you pay them to ship printed photos to your home 
address.

- Problem:
Nobody keeps photos on their machine anymore, they use the cloud and 
so you keep getting this feature request to provide users the ability 
to import their photos from somewhere like Google Drive and then 
print directly from there without the user having to download and 
upload again.

-------------------                 -----------------------
| Photo Print App |     <---------  | Google Drive Service|
-------------------     JWT Token   -----------------------

Here Photo Print App will ask the user for their Google ID and 
password, you con say that, hey user do you want me to print your 
photos from Google Drive - Google doesn't give me access --> (Not possible: Because
User can give access to certain photos, they don't give you access to their whole Google Drive.

- Solution:
Services are trying to access each other on behalf of the user there 
was the standard created called oAuth.

Ex:
You must have heard of Parking attendants are valleys. The idea is 
that a guy drives up to a parking garage and he gets down and hands 
his key to the valet and say hey man please park this car.

Some car come with an additional key called the valet key, the valet 
key is just like the main key but few access like this valet key can 
start and stop the car, but it can not open the trunk/the glove 
compartment restrictions like that.
