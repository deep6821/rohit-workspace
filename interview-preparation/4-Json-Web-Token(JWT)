What is JSON Web Token?
----------------------
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for
securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified
and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm)
or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA

When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
-----------------------------------
Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
1. Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT.  Once the user is logged in,  each
subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources
that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because
of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

2. Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.
Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who
they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload,  you can
also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

What is the JSON Web Token structure?
------------------------------------
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
1. Header -->> The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the
signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

EX: {"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}
Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

2. Payload -->> The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements
about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered,
public, and private claims.

a) Registered claims: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but  recommended,  to
provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp  (expiration time),  sub
(subject), aud (audience), and others. Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is
meant to be compact.

b) Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be
defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant
namespace.

c) Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on
using them and are neither registered or public claims.

Ex: {"sub": "1234567890", "name": "John Doe", "admin": true}
The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.

3. Signature: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a
secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)

Putting all together: The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in
HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.


How do JSON Web Tokens work?
---------------------------
In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be
returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general,
you should not keep tokens longer than required.

You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security.

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT,
typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. The content of the header should look like
the following: Authorization: Bearer <token>

This can be, in certain cases, a stateless authorization mechanism. The server's protected routes will
check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access
protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for certain
operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case.

If the token is sent in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as
it doesn't use cookies.


1. The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through
one of the different authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application
will go through the /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.
2. When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.
3. The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).

Why should we use JSON Web Tokens?
---------------------------------
Let's talk about the benefits of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) when compared to Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and
Security Assertion Markup Language Tokens (SAML).

- As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller, making JWT more compact than
SAML. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

- Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. However,
JWT and SAML tokens can use a public/private key pair in the form of a X.509 certificate for signing.
Signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult when
compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.

- JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. Conversely,
XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML
assertions.

- Regarding usage, JWT is used at Internet scale. This highlights the ease of client-side processing of the
JSON Web token on multiple platforms, especially mobile.

------------
- pip install pyjwt

# Encoding & Decoding Tokens with HS256
import jwt
key = 'secret'
encoded = jwt.encode({'some': 'payload'}, key, algorithm='HS256')
print(encoded) # 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb21lIjoicGF5bG9hZCJ9.4twFt5NiznN84AWoo1d7KO1T_yoc0Z6XOpOVswacPZg'
decoded = jwt.decode(encoded, key, algorithms='HS256')
print(decoded) # {'some': 'payload'}

# Encoding & Decoding Tokens with RS256 (RSA)
import jwt
private_key = b'-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIGEAgEAMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBS...'
public_key = b'-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMHYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAC...'

print(encoded) # 'eyJhbGciOiJIU...'
decoded = jwt.decode(encoded, public_key, algorithms='RS256')
print(encoded) # {'some': 'payload'}

# Specifying Additional Headers
jwt.encode({'some': 'payload'}, 'secret', algorithm='HS256', headers={'key': '230498151c214b788dd97f22b85410a5'})

# Reading the Claimset without Validation
jwt.decode(encoded, verify=False)

# Reading Headers without Validation
