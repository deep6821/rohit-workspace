A partition can be consumed by one or more consumers, each reading at different offsets.

In consumer groups several consumers are grouped to consume a given topic. Consumers in the same consumer
group are assigned the same group-id value.

The consumer group concept ensures that a message is only ever read by a single consumer in the group.

When a consumer group consumes the partitions of a topic, Kafka makes sure that each partition is consumed
by exactly one consumer in the group.

Consumer groups enable consumers to parallelize and process messages at very high throughputs. However,
the maximum parallelism of a group will be equal to the number of partitions of that topic.

For example, if you have N + 1 consumers for a topic with N partitions, then the first N consumers will be
assigned a topic, and the remaining consumer will be idle, unless one of the N consumers fails, then the
waiting consumer will be assigned its partition. This is a good strategy to implement a hot failover.

*** The key takeaway is that number of consumers don’t govern the degree of parallelism of a topic. It’s
the number of partitions ***
