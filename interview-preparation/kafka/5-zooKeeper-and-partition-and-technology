1. What is the role of the ZooKeeper in Kafka?

- Apache Kafka is a distributed system is built to use Zookeeper.
- Although, Zookeeperâ€™s main role here is to build coordination between different nodes in a cluster.
- However, we also use Zookeeper to recover from previously committed offset if any node fails because it works as
periodically commit offset.

2. Is it possible to use Kafka without ZooKeeper?

- It is impossible to bypass Zookeeper and connect directly to the Kafka server, so the answer is no.
- If somehow, ZooKeeper is down, then it is impossible to service any client request.

3. What do you know about Partition in Kafka?

-  In every Kafka broker, there are few partitions available.
- And, here each partition in Kafka can be either a leader or a replica of a topic.

4. Why is Kafka technology significant to use?

a) High-throughput:
- We do not need any large hardware in Kafka, because it is capable of handling high-velocity and high-volume data.
- Moreover, it can also support message throughput of thousands of messages per second.

b) Low Latency:
- Kafka can easily handle these messages with the very low latency of the range of milliseconds, demanded by most of
the new use cases.

c) Fault-Tolerant:
- Kafka is resistant to node/machine failure within a cluster.

d) Durability
- As Kafka supports messages replication, so,  messages are never lost. It is one of the reasons behind durability.

e) Scalability:
- Kafka can be scaled-out, without incurring any downtime on the fly by adding additional nodes.
