1. In the Producer, when does QueueFullException occur?

- Whenever the Kafka Producer attempts to send messages at a pace that the Broker cannot handle at that time
QueueFullException typically occurs.

- However, to collaboratively handle the increased load, users will need to add enough brokers, since the Producer
doesnâ€™t block.

2. Explain the role of the Kafka Producer API.

- An API which permits an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics is what we call
Producer API.
