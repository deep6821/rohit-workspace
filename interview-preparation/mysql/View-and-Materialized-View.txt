Key Differences Between View and Materialized View:
---------------------------------------------------
1. The basic difference between View and Materialized View is that Views are not stored physically on the
disk. On the other hands, Materialized Views are stored on the disc.

2. View can be defined as a virtual table created as a result of the query expression. However,
Def: Materialized View is a physical copy, picture or snapshot of the base table.

3. A view is always updated as the query creating View executes each time the View is used. On the other
hands, Materialized View is updated manually or by applying triggers to it.

4. Materialized View responds faster than View as the Materialized View is precomputed.
View: slower because of it computed each time(If you update any content in View, it is reflected in the
original table, and if any changes had been done to the original base table, it would reflect in its View)

5. Materialized View utilizes the memory space as it stored on the disk whereas, the View is just a
display hence it do not require memory space.

** Materialized Views are generally used in the data warehouse.
